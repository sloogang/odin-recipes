    <h1>Description</h1>
    <p>When I was little, my father was famous<br>
        He was the greatest samurai in the empire<br>
        And he was the Shogun's decapitator<br>
        He cut off the heads of 131 lords<br>
        It was a bad time for the empire<br>
        The Shogun just stayed inside his castle and he never came out<br>
        People said his brain was infected by devils<br>
        My father would come home, he would forget about the killings<br>   
        He wasn't scared of the Shogun, but the Shogun was scared of him<br>
        Maybe that was the problem<br>
        Then, one night, the Shogun sent his ninja spies to our house<br>
        They were supposed to kill my father but they didn't<br>
        *Woman screaming*<br>
        That was the night everything changed</p>
